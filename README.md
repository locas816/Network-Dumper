# NetworkDumper
A network Packet Sniffing tool.

This is a simple and easy project to capture network traffic of your device and view those packet. I complete this project as my semester end project.
This uses `Python` language for main programming language and `CSS` for the styling the GUI.

## Starting
To use this project first you need to install all the packages from the `requirements.txt` file using pip command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This project uses python libraries `PyQt5` and `Scapy` on it's core. After the installation fo the packages, run the `main.py` file in superuser or root previllage to allow access for the Network Packets.
